This dataset provides comprehensive historical population data for countries and territories globally, offering insights into various parameters such as area size, continent, population growth rates, rankings, and world population percentages. Spanning from 1970 to 2023, it includes population figures for different years, enabling a detailed examination of demographic trends and changes over time.
Using Python and popular libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover key trends and insights. This project not only helped me enhance my data manipulation and visualization skills but also deepened my understanding of global demographic shifts over the past few decades.
